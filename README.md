  The goal of this project is to create a website using Oracle VM, Ubuntu Server, Docker-engine and the web template from Tooplate.com. The website will be hosted on Github and will include a detailed readme file.

The first step in this project will be to set up an Oracle VM using the Ubuntu Server. Once the VM is up and running, we will install the Docker-engine on the server. This will allow us to run Docker containers on the server.

Next, we will use the Tooplate.com HTML template to create the website. We will customize the template to match our desired design and functionality. This will include editing the HTML and CSS files, as well as adding any necessary features such as forms and authentication.

Once the website is complete, we will use Docker to containerize the application. This will allow us to easily deploy the website to different environments without the need to make any configuration changes.

After the website is containerized, we will push the image to Github. We will then create a detailed readme file that explains how to run the website using the Docker image. This will include instructions on how to set up the Oracle VM and Docker-engine, as well as how to run the website using the Docker image.

Throughout the project, we will use Github's monitoring and logging tools to ensure that the website is running smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Overall, this project will involve setting up an Oracle VM, installing the Docker-engine, using a pre-built HTML template from Tooplate.com to create a website, containerizing the application and deploying the website on Github with a readme file. The end result will be a fully functioning website hosted on Github, that can be easily deployed using the Docker image.
