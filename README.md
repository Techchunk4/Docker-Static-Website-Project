# Docker VM Setup with Vagrant

This repository contains configurations to set up a Virtual Machine (VM) with Docker using Vagrant. It provides a consistent environment for Docker-based development, encapsulated within a VM.

## Prerequisites

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (or another provider supported by Vagrant)
- Git (optional, but recommended for cloning this repository)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository (Optional):**

   If you've chosen to use Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-dir
   ```

2. **Start and Provision the VM:**

   From the directory of the project, initiate:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

   This command sets up the VM, installs Docker and any other necessary tools or software.

3. **SSH into the VM:**

   Access the VM's terminal with:
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```

4. **Using Docker:**

   Once inside the VM, Docker is available for use:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker run hello-world
   ```

5. **Stopping the VM:**

   To shut down the VM when you're done:
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```

6. **Destroy the VM (Optional):**

   If you want to remove the VM from your system:
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy
   ```

   To recreate it, just use `vagrant up` again.

## Configuration Details

- **Base Box:** The VM uses "ubuntu/bionic64" as its base image. You can change this in the `Vagrantfile` if needed.

- **Provisioning:** Docker and its prerequisites are installed via a provisioning script (`provision.sh`). Adjust this script as needed for additional configurations or software.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Docker commands not working:** Ensure the VM is running with `vagrant status` and that Docker was correctly installed during the provisioning phase.

2. **Vagrant issues:** Ensure that Vagrant and VirtualBox (or your selected provider) are updated. Some problems might be resolved by simply updating these tools.
